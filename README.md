A flexible mapping framework for Julia that provides different parallel backends, progress tracking, and iteration patterns.

## Features

- **Multiple backends**: Sequential, Threads, Distributed, and Dagger execution
- **Progress tracking**: Support for various progress-logging backends
- **Nested array support**: Map over specific leaf types in nested array structures
- **Cartesian expansions**: Easy cartesian product iterations

## Quick Start

```julia
using MoreMaps

# Basic usage with default sequential backend
x = rand(100)
C = Chart()
y = map(sqrt, C, x)

# Use threading for parallel execution
C_threaded = Chart(Threaded())
y_threaded = map(sqrt, C_threaded, x)

# Add progress tracking
C_progress = Chart(Threaded(), InfoProgress(10))
y_progress = map(sqrt, C_progress, x)
```

## Basics

The basis of a `MoreMaps` map is the `Chart` type, which configures how mapping operations are executed.

A `Chart` has the following fields:

- `backend`: Specifies the execution backend
- `progress`: Configures the progress logging behavior
- `leaf`: Defines the element type where recursion terminates, for mapping nested arrays
- `expansion`: Determines the expansion strategy (e.g. Cartesian product)

A chart can be constructed using keywords or arbitrary-order positional arguments. The default `Chart()` reproduces `Base.map()`, and is constructed as:

```julia
C = Chart(backend=Sequential(),    # No parallel execution; similar to Base.map
          progress=NoProgress(),   # No progress logging
          leaf=MoreMaps.All,                # Map over each element of the root array, like Base.map
          expansion=NoExpansion()) # Map over the original input arrays, as for Base.map

# Or
C = Chart(Sequential(), NoProgress(), MoreMaps.All, NoExpansion()) # In any order

# Default behavior
C == Chart()
```

Once you have a Chart, pass it to the standard `Base.map` function:

```julia
x = rand(10)
C = Chart()
y = map(sqrt, C, x)
y == map(sqrt, x) # Default behavior reproduces Base.map
```

## Backends

- `Sequential`: Default, no parallelism
- `Threads`: Uses `Threads.jl`
- `Distributed`: Uses `Distributed.jl` (pmap)
- `Daggermap`: Uses `Dagger.jl`

## Progress loggers

- `NoProgress`: No progress logging
- `InfoProgress`: Logs progress information with `@info`
- `ProgressLogger`: Uses `ProgressLogging.jl`
- `TermLogger`: Uses `Term.jl`

## Leaf types

- `MoreMaps.All`: Matches all element types; maps over each element of the root array
- `Union{}`: Matches no element types; always recurses to the last non-iterable type
- Specific types: Recurse until the first element of a given type is found
